Twitter and OpenStack clients
=============================

A toy program for leaning openstack-clients and twitter api

What is this?
=============

Just a toy.
Search tweets from twitter which interested in openstack.
If the tweet found, a new vm launched on my openstack cloud.
Of cause, it can't access from internet.

Why I make it?
==============

For my study the openstack and twitter api.
